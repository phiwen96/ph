# Introduction



"ph" is the fastest and safest c++ library in the world.

It introduces c++ concepts and modules, by which the former it is built around, thus, making it lucrative for industrial applications where the need for precision is critical, and where most of the bugs can be catched before the c++ files are compiled, thus simply just generating a syntax error for the developer. This is what we want! We dont want python's "throw in whatever type u desire", and not java's "please specify the type". We want to be able to say "hey, other coders out there using this function im about to type, just throw in a String". String could be everything from "std::string" to old plain c string "char const *".
